                            There will be an add movies text box at the bottom of the page. You can type any movie into there and hit the add movie button to add the movie to your list. While you are typing there will be autocomplete
                            boxes popping up underneath the text box. The movies that are tracked by autocomplete are any movie that is streamable! If you click on the autocomplete box that you want, it will populate the textbox with that movie.
                            If a movie is a streamable, it will show icons next to its name in your list of the locations that it is streamable from.

                            Next to each movie in your list there is a drop down menu. This drop down menu has a variety of ratings that you can choose from and also a remove movie choice that removes the movie from your
                            list. Upon choosing a rating, the movie will be added to the watched movie portion of the screen and will no longer be able to be randomly chosen by the random movie chooser button.
